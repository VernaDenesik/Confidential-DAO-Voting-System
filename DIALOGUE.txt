Confidential DAO Voting System - Video Narration Script

Scene 1: Opening & Problem Statement

Traditional blockchain voting systems have a critical flaw: they're completely transparent. This means votes can be bought, voters can be coerced, and early results manipulate later votes. We need a better solution.

Scene 2: Commit-Reveal Mechanism Demo

Introducing the commit-reveal voting mechanism. In phase one, voters submit an encrypted hash of their vote without revealing their actual choice. Only after voting ends can they reveal their decision with cryptographic proof. This guarantees privacy during voting and prevents manipulation.

Scene 3: Live Application Demo

Here's how it works in practice. Connect your Web3 wallet, browse active governance proposals, and cast your vote. During the commit phase, your vote is encrypted on-chain. After the deadline, you reveal your choice and the smart contract verifies your commitment matches. Everything is transparent and verifiable, yet completely private during voting.

Scene 4: Key Features Highlight

Our system provides four critical guarantees: cryptographic privacy protection, anti-manipulation security, weighted voting power based on token holdings, and blockchain-verified proof of every vote. All running on Ethereum with full smart contract transparency.
